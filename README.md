# Ruby On Rails Developer.tech

Hi welcome to my Ruby on Rails Developer application.  I created this application so I could have a live web application to work on while I'm working to improve my web development skills.  

My goal for this site is to build a new feature each week.  While building these features I am concentrating on building my software development process.  I've been a craftsman all my life.  I started doing woodworking when I was 8 and got my first table saw when I was 12. That's when I really started to discover that everything had a process.  The tricky part is always finding a mentor to teach you his process or finding a book that breaks it down so you can understand the why behind the actions we take.

Week 0 : Project setup.
The site isn't going to do much at the end of week zero.  In fact it'll just be a landing page explaining the objective of the site and that's pretty much it.  For a little bit of background:
+ Ruby version 2.5.3
+ Rails version 5.2.1
+ Database is Postgres.
+ The site will be hosted at [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com).
+ Rspec will be used for testing.
